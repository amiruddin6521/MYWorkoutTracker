# MYWorkoutTracker
MY Workout Tracker is a mobile application that record user daily workout. 

## Problem statement
The problem that caused the existence of this application is because user sometime can be hard to keep track of their workout that 
result unorganized workout and can be bad for their health. Another problem founds is user can be hard to get know the progression of
their workout and body evolution, so that also can cause unmotivated workout too. Besides that, user hard to remember what machine 
they used when doing workout activity that make user do not know where to start their workout.

## Function module
- This apps can track their workout, cardio, weight and body size too. So, user can track their progress easily and quickly. 
- Graphical report also provided in this app. It will help user to follow their progression and the evolution of their body based on 
the all workout record.
- User also can create as many machines as they want with the name they wanted too. No useless exercises are pre-created because user 
create their own exercise depending on the name of the machine user have in their workout place.
